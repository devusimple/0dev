# Getting Started with Next.js and MDX

Next.js has become one of the most popular React frameworks for building modern web applications. Combined with MDX (Markdown for the component era), it provides a powerful platform for creating content-rich websites like blogs, documentation sites, and more.

In this comprehensive guide, we'll walk through setting up a Next.js project with MDX support, configuring it for optimal performance, and implementing common blog features like:

- Dynamic routing for blog posts
- Frontmatter parsing for metadata
- Custom components in markdown
- Syntax highlighting for code blocks
- And more!

## Setting Up Your Next.js Project

First, let's create a new Next.js project. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npx create-next-app my-blog-app
cd my-blog-app
